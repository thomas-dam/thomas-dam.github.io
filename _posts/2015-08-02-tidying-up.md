After i read Marie Kondos [The life changing magic of tidying up.](http://tidyingup.com) i started to compile a list of the 100 only things i need. <!--more--> 
A little scared of how fast it is growning and how difficult if can be to say goodbye to the material things, you THINK you need.
I will post the list here when it is finished.
